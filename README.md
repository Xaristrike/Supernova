## Introduction
This project demonstrates a line follower robot designed to navigate a path marked by a line on the ground. The robot uses sensors to detect the line and adjusts its movement 
accordingly to stay on course. This repository includes detailed instructions, code, and a list of parts to help you recreate the project.

## Features
- Autonomous navigation using line detection
- Real-time sensor data processing
- Smooth and responsive control mechanisms

## Hardware Requirements
To build the line follower robot, you will need the following components:
- Microcontroller (RP 2040)
- DC motors (4x)
- Line tracking sensors (5 IR sensors)
- Chassis (robot frame)
- Wheels (4x)
- Power supply (A battery pack with 4 AA batteries)
- Connecting wires
- Miscellaneous tools (screwdrivers and a lot of tape)

## Software Setup
The following software tools are required to develop and upload the code to the microcontroller:
- Thonny IDE

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/line-follower-robot.git
```
2. Install Thonny IDE on your operating system according to the instructions from Thonny's website.

## Usage
1. Assemble the line follower.
2. Connect it to a computer and upload the code using Thonny IDE.
3. Place the robot on the line track.
4. Hold the "GP20" button for 3 seconds.
5. The robot will begin to move on the line.

## Testing
1. Assemble the line follower
2. Connect it to a compujter and upload the code using Thonny IDE.
3. Hold the "GP21" button for 3 seconds. Make sure the line follower wheels are not touching the ground.
4. The motors will begin to slowly throttle up and down so you can see their performance.
